## Nand2Tetris
This repository contains my code for the final project of 'Nand2Tetris' project-based course by Jerusalem University.
I had to implement an assembler program in a high-level scripting language that would translate prog.asm files into prog.hack files
to run on the Hack computer. I implemented the Hack Assembler in Python according to provided API.
